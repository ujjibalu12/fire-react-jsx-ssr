FireJSX is the framework required by modern react developers üòé to build great sites with ease. 

FireJSX allows you to build **professional** static/dynamic websites with no limitations whatsoever. FireJSX sites are fully functional React apps, allowing you to create high-quality, dynamic/static web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

FireJSX handles page preloading, builds optimised chunks, grows with you using powerful plugin API, saves your sweet-sweet moneyüí∞ because FireJSX sites are very-very efficient and cheap to host. Go Serverless, SSR or just dump your SSB to an S3 bucket. There is no limit to what you can do with FireJSX.

## How is it different ? üëΩ

+ Server Side Render with maximum of 3 lines of code. No need to fake an express server.

+ Lightning fast rendering with latency as low as 3ms.

+ Portable code. Export for fly builds once. Run it any-where. No need to carry node_modules around. Reduced cold start
  time.

+ 0 overhead, means smaller bundle sizes and faster apps. Bundle sizes smaller by at least 100kb when compared to other
  frameworks.

+ Dev Friendly. Low build time through build time caching.

+ Advance caching mechanism ensures lightning fast routing.

+ Made with the thought of Long term caching for fast cdn delivery

+ Easily pull in data from any data source and pass it to your page with no confusing and buggy `getInitialProps`
  or getServerSideProps. Moreover, you don't need to learn any extra technology such as `GraphQL` or worry about
  efficiency and code spitting.

+ Customizable. Customize the framework to your liking.

+ Scalable. Grow feature set using easy to write plugins.

+ Easy to use node interface. You are not limited to the cli interface anymore.

+ Modern. Made with serverless technological services in mind.
